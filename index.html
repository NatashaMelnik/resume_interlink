            Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their
            Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow
            peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of
            the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a
            mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.
          </p>
          <p class="biography-text">
            At first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by
            adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He
            should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his
            invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a
            prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif
            quietly mutter, "It could go either way." No firmer statement could
            he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his
            army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from
            all possible allies. He took "It could go either way" to indicate
            that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his
            plan.
          </p>
          <!-- <p class="biography-text">
            The immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to
            comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the
            Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap
            fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split
            and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them
            populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to
            feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.
          </p> -->
          <p class="biography-text">
            Long before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's
            wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched
            him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in
            the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever.
            It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us.
